Description: This package will provides a consistent, automated framework for generating probabilistic predictions and evaluating models using proper scoring rules.
It will also allow users to evaluate diverse model types—from traditional statistical models to machine learning algorithms—with a unified API.
Also this package will support data scientists and business decision-makers by incorporating uncertainty in model predictions and providing more robust evaluation metrics than conventional point-based approaches.
