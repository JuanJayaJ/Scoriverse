Description: DraftScoriverse provides a unified framework for generating probabilistic predictions 
    and evaluating model performance using proper scoring rules. The package supports 
    outcome-scale sampling for a variety of statistical models, including generalized linear models (GLM), 
    generalized additive models (GAM), Bayesian models fitted with 'brms', and tidymodels workflows. 
    Key features include posterior predictive draws, scoring metrics such as CRPS, Log Score, 
    Brier Score, Interval Score, and DSS, as well as visualization tools for diagnostic evaluation. 
    The package is designed to facilitate robust, probabilistic model assessment with consistent 
    interfaces across supported model types.
