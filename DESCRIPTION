Description: This package will provides a consistent, automated framework for 
generating probabilistic predictions and evaluating models using proper 
scoring rules.
It will also allow users to evaluate diverse model types—from traditional 
statistical models to machine learning algorithms—with a unified API.
This package will support data scientists and business decision-makers by 
incorporating uncertainty in model predictions and providing more robust 
evaluation metrics than conventional point-based approaches.
