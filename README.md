# Scoriverse

**Probabilistic Prediction Scoring and Evaluation Framework**  
Version: 0.0.1   
License: MIT

---

## Overview

**Scoriverse** provides a flexible and unified framework for generating probabilistic predictions and evaluating models using **proper scoring rules**. It supports **outcome-scale sampling**, **posterior predictive draws**, and **modular scoring tools** across a range of statistical modeling approaches, including:

- ✅ Generalized Linear Models (GLM)
- ✅ Generalized Additive Models (GAM)
- ✅ Bayesian models via `brms`
- ✅ Tidymodels workflows

This framework enhances uncertainty-aware evaluation by offering a consistent API for comparing model performance using well-established probabilistic metrics.

## Key Features

- Outcome-scale sampling for GLM, GAM, and Bayesian models  
- Posterior predictive draws using proper random number generation  
- Support for multiple model classes: `glm`, `gam`, `brmsfit`, and `workflow`  
- Proper scoring rules:
  - Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)
  - Logarithmic Score (Log Score)
  - Dawid-Sebastiani Score (DSS)
  - Interval Score
  - Brier Score
- Diagnostic visualizations for prediction and residual analysis  
- Unified wrapper functions for predictions and scoring

## Installation

To install the development version from your local tarball:

```r
install.packages("path/to/DraftScoriverse_0.0.1.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

---

## Usage Example

```r
library(DraftScoriverse)
library(MASS)

# Fit a Negative Binomial GLM
data <- data.frame(count = rnbinom(100, size = 2, mu = 5), x = rnorm(100))
model <- glm.nb(count ~ x, data = data)

# Generate samples
samples <- extract_predictions(model, new_data = data, return_samples = TRUE, n_samples = 100)

# Evaluate CRPS
scores <- wrap_scoring("crps", y_true = data$count, predictions = samples)
```

## Supported Models

| Model Type            | Sampling Support                                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **GLM** (`glm`)        | Outcome-scale sampling with `rnorm()`, `rpois()`, etc.   |
| **GAM** (`gam`)        | Posterior predictive sampling via `gratia::fitted_samples()` |
| **Bayesian** (`brms`)  | Posterior predictive draws via `posterior_predict()`     |
| **Tidymodels** (`workflow`) | Point prediction only; no posterior samples           |
