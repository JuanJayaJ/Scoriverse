# DraftScoriverse

**Probabilistic Prediction Scoring and Evaluation Framework**

*Version: 0.0.1*

## Overview

`DraftScoriverse` provides a flexible and unified framework for probabilistic prediction generation and model evaluation using proper scoring rules. The package supports outcome-scale sampling and evaluation across a variety of statistical modeling approaches, including:

- Generalized Linear Models (GLM)
- Generalized Additive Models (GAM)
- Bayesian models fitted via `brms`
- Tidymodels workflows

This framework facilitates robust uncertainty quantification and scoring through a consistent API, making it easier to compare model performance using well-established probabilistic metrics.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Outcome-scale sampling** for GLM, GAM, and Bayesian models
- **Posterior predictive draws** using proper random number generation
- **Support for multiple model classes** (GLM, GAM, brmsfit, tidymodels workflows)
- **Proper scoring rules**:
  - Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)
  - Logarithmic Score (Log Score)
  - Brier Score
  - Interval Score
  - Dawid-Sebastiani Score (DSS)
- **Diagnostic visualizations** for prediction assessment
- **Unified wrapper functions** for prediction extraction and scoring

## ðŸš€ Installation

To install the development version of the package from your local directory:

```r
install.packages("path_to_your_downloaded/DraftScoriverse_0.0.1.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

## ðŸ“¦ Package Usage

### Prediction and Sampling Example:

```r
library(DraftScoriverse)
library(MASS)

data <- data.frame(count = rnbinom(100, size = 2, mu = 5), x = rnorm(100))
model <- glm.nb(count ~ x, data = data)

samples <- extract_predictions(model, new_data = data, return_samples = TRUE, n_samples = 100)

scores <- wrap_scoring(score_type = "crps", y_true = data$count, predictions = samples)
```

| `crps`      | `pred_mean`, `pred_sd`          | Continuous Ranked Probability Score        |
| `log_score` | `pred_mean`, `pred_sd`          | Logarithmic Score for density functions    |
| `brier`     | `pred_prob`                     | Brier Score for binary classification      |
| `interval`  | `lower`, `upper`                | Interval Score for prediction intervals    |
| `dss`       | `pred_mean`, `pred_sd`          | Dawid-Sebastiani Score                     |

## ðŸ“‚ Supported Models

| Model Type           | Supported Sampling                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| GLM                  | Outcome-scale sampling with appropriate RNGs |
| GAM (`mgcv`)         | Outcome-scale sampling, posterior uncertainty handling |
| brmsfit (`brms`)     | Posterior predictive draws via `posterior_predict()` |
| Tidymodels workflows | Standard prediction extraction (no posterior sampling) |
